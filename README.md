# hedhehog_web
Website for summer school. Codename "hedgehog".

"HHschool" intended to be yet another summer school in mathematics and physics. To draw attention of pupils, there was an idea to post video lectures and assignments for everyone.   

This website supported:  
1) User registration;  
2) Ability to add "block of lectures" (like "Math for 7-8 grade");  
3) Modify any "block of lectures": add\remove\edit video lessons;  
4) Submit files for homeworks (only registered users);
5) Submit an e-mail for "contact us" (any user).  

Few pictures of localhost version (it was available on hhschool.ru with appropriate information):

As the project was starting, it gained attention from handful of pupils, but then our video production team lost interest to continue.
